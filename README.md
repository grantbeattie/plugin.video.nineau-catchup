NineAU catch-up addon for XBMC
==============================

This addon provides content from the Channel Nine (Australia) catch-up TV service "jump-in".

Installation
------------
The latest release can be downloaded from the [releases] page. Download the zip file to your XBMC device and install
via System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file

Android and xbmc pre-v13/Gotham
-------------------------------
You may need to enable SSL compatibility mode in the addon settings to allow HLS streaming to work. This is due to
previous versions and Android builds not including gnutls support by default, and the compatibility mode workaround
should allow SSL HLS streams to work on these platforms/versions.

Issues
------
For issues or bug reports, please file them on the [issues page] [issues].

Please include log output using [Github Gist] [gist].
